<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p class='dropcap'><span class="caps">The</span> subject of compounds is one of the most difficult of the matters
relating to correct literary composition. The difficulty arises from the
fact that usage, especially in the matter of the presence or absence of
the hyphen, is not clearly settled. Progressive tendencies are at work
and there is great difference of usage, even among authorities of the
first rank, with regard to many compounds in common use.</p>

<p>An attempt is made to show first the general character of the problems
involved. Then follows a discussion of the general principles of
compounding. The general rules for the formation of compounds are stated
and briefly discussed. The various components of compounds are fully
analyzed and tabulated. The best modern usage in the matter of the
employment of the hyphen is set forth in a series of rules. The whole is
concluded by practical advice to the compositor as to the use of the
rules in the actual work of the office.</p>

<h2>COMPOUND WORDS</h2>

<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

<p class='dropcap'><span class="caps">The</span> English language contains a great many words and phrases which are
made up of two or more words combined or related in such a way as to
form a new verbal phrase having a distinct meaning of its own and
differing in meaning from the sum of the component words taken singly.
<i>Income</i> and <i>outgo</i>, for example, have quite definite meanings related,
it is true, to <i>come</i> and <i>go</i> and to <i>in</i> and <i>out</i>, but sharply
differentiated from those words in their ordinary and general
signification. We use these compound words and phrases so commonly that
we never stop to think how numerous they are, or how frequently new ones
are coined. Any living language is constantly growing and developing new
forms. New objects have to be named, new sensations expressed, new experiences described.</p>

<p>Sometimes these words are mere aggregations like <i>automobile</i>,
<i>monotype</i>, <i>sidewalk</i>, <i>policeman</i> and the like. Sometimes, indeed very
often, they are short cuts. A <i>hatbox</i> is a box for carrying a hat, a
<i>red-haired</i> man is a man with red hair. A <i>bookcase</i> is a case to contain books, etc.</p>

<p>Sometimes the phrase consists of two or more separate words, such as
<i>well known</i> or <i>nicely kept</i>. Sometimes it consists of words joined by
a hyphen, such as <i>boarding-house</i>, <i>sleeping-car</i>. Sometimes it
consists of a single word formed by amalgamating or running together the
components, such as <i>penholder</i>, <i>nevertheless</i>.</p>

<p>In which of these forms shall we write the phrase we speak so easily?
How shall we shape the new word we have just coined? Which of these
three forms shall we use, and why? Ordinarily we look for the answer to
such questions from three sources, historical development, the past of
the language; some logical principle of general application; or some
recognized standard of authority.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span> Unfortunately we get little help from
either of these sources in this special difficulty.</p>

<p>The history of the language is a history of constant change. The
Anglo-Saxon tongue was full of compounds, but the hyphen was an unknown
device to those who spoke it. The English of Chaucer, the period when
our new-born English tongue was differentiated from those which
contributed to its composition, is full of compounds, and the compounds
were generally written with a hyphen. Shakespeare used many compound
words and phrases some of which sound strange, if not uncouth, to modern
ears, but used the hyphen much less than Chaucer. In modern times the
tendency has been and is to drop the hyphen. The more general
progression seems to be (1) two words, (2) two words hyphenated, (3) two
words run together into one. Sometimes, however, the hyphen drops,
leaving two words separated. That there is constant change, and that the
change is progressing consistently in the direction of eliminating the
hyphen is fairly clear. This, however, does not help us much. At what
stage of the process are we with regard to any given word? Which form of
the process is operating in any given case?</p>

<p>There are no laws or principles of universal application on which we may
build a consistent system of practice. Certain general principles have
been laid down and will be here set forth. While they are helpful to the
understanding of the subject they are not sufficiently universal to
serve as practical guides in all cases. In any event they need to be
supplemented by careful study of the rules for the use of the hyphen, by
careful study of the best usage in particular cases, and by thorough
knowledge of the style of each particular office, as will be pointed out
later. Authorities and usage differ widely, and it is often difficult to
say that a particular form is right or wrong.</p>

<p>There is no recognized standard authority. The dictionaries do not agree
with each other and are not always consistent with themselves. They may
always write a certain word in a certain way but they may write another
word to all appearance exactly analogous to the first in another<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span> way.
For example Worcester has <i>brickwork</i> and <i>brasswork</i>, but <i>wood-work</i>
and <i>iron-work</i>. Webster, on the other hand, has <i>woodwork</i> and <i>brick-work</i>.</p>

<p>The best that the printer can do is to adopt a set of rules or style of
his own and stick to it consistently. Here and there a generally
accepted change, like the dropping of the hyphen from <i>tomorrow</i> and
<i>today</i> will force itself upon him, but for the most part he may stick
to his style. Of course, the author, if he has a marked preference, must
be permitted to use his own methods of compounding except in magazine
publications and the like. In such cases, when the author&#8217;s work is to
appear in the same volume with that of other writers, the style of the
printing office must rule and the individual contributors must bow to
it.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>
<h3>GENERAL PRINCIPLES</h3>

<p class='dropcap'><span class="caps">Three</span> general principles are laid down by Mr. F. Horace Teall which will
be found useful, though they must be supplemented in practice by more
specific rules which will be given later. They are as follows:</p>

<p>I<span class="spacer2">&nbsp;</span>All words should be separate when used in regular grammatical
relations and construction unless they are jointly applied in some arbitrary way.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>An <i>iron fence</i> means a fence made of iron. The meaning and
construction are normal and the words are not compounded.</p>

<p>An <i>iron-saw</i> means a saw for cutting iron. The meaning is not the
same as <i>iron saw</i> which would mean a saw made of iron. The
hyphenated compound indicates the special meaning of the words used in this combination.</p>

<p><i>Ironwood</i> is a specific name applied to a certain kind of very
hard wood. Hence, it becomes a single word compounded but without a
hyphen. Either of the other forms would be ambiguous or impossible in meaning.</p></div>

<p>II<span class="spacer2">&nbsp;</span>Abnormal associations of words generally indicate unification in
sense and hence compounding in form.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A <i>sleeping man</i> is a phrase in which the words are associated
normally. The man sleeps.</p>

<p>A <i>sleeping-car</i> is a phrase in which the words are associated
abnormally. The car does not sleep. It is a specially constructed
car in which the passengers may sleep comfortably.</p>

<p>A <i>king fisher</i> might be a very skilful fisherman. A <i>kingfisher</i>
is a kind of bird. Here again we have an abnormal association of
words and as the compound word is the name of a specific sort of
bird there is no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span> hyphen. A <i>king-fisher</i>, if it meant anything,
would probably mean one who fished for kings, as a <i>pearl-diver</i> is one who dives for pearls.</p></div>

<p>III<span class="spacer2">&nbsp;</span>Conversely, no expression in the language should ever be changed
from two or more words into one (either hyphenated or solid) without change of sense.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Saw trimmer</i> is not compounded because there is no change in the
commonly accepted sense of either word.</p>

<p><i>Color work</i> is not compounded because the word <i>color</i>, by usage
common in English, has the force of an adjective, and the words are
used in their accepted sense. In other languages it would be
differently expressed, for example, in French it would be <i>oeuvre</i>,
or <i>imprimerie en couleur</i>, <i>work</i>, or, <i>printing in color</i>.</p>

<p><i>Presswork</i> is compounded because it has a special and specific
meaning. Good or bad presswork is a good or bad result of work done on a press.</p>

<p>Here as everywhere in printing the great purpose is to secure
plainness and intelligibility. Print is made to read. Anything
which obscures the sense, or makes the passage hard to read is
wrong. Anything which clears up the sense and makes the passage
easy to read and capable of only one interpretation is right.</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>INFLUENCE OF ACCENT IN COMPOUNDING</h3>

<p>Some writers lay much stress on the influence of accent in the formation
of compounds while others ignore it entirely. Accent undoubtedly has
some influence and the theory may be easily and intelligibly expressed.
It ought to be understood, but it will not be found an entirely safe
guide. Usage has modified the results of compounding in many cases in
ways which do not lend themselves to logical explanation and classification.</p>

<p>The general principle as stated by Mr. Teall is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>When each part of the compound is accented, use the hyphen; <i>laughter-loving</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>When only one part is accented, omit the hyphen; <i>many sided</i>.</p>

<p>When the accent is changed, print the compound solid; <i>broadsword</i>.
This follows the general rule of accenting the first syllable in English words.</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>RULES FOR THE FORMATION OF COMPOUNDS</h3>

<p>I<span class="spacer2">&nbsp;</span>Two nouns used together as a name form a compound noun unless:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(<i>a</i>) The first is used in a descriptive or attributive sense, that is, is really an adjective, or</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The two are in apposition.</p></div>

<p>Various uses of the noun as an adjective, that is, in some qualifying or
attributive sense are when the noun conveys the sense of:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. &#8220;Made of;&#8221; <i>leather belt</i>, <i>steel furniture</i>.</p>

<p>2. &#8220;Having the shape, character, or quality of;&#8221; <i>diamond pane</i>,
<i>iron ration</i>, <i>bull calf</i>.</p>

<p>3. &#8220;Pertaining to, suitable for, representing;&#8221; <i>office desk</i>, <i>labor union</i>.</p>

<p>4. &#8220;Characterized by;&#8221; <i>motor drive</i>.</p>

<p>5. &#8220;Situated in, and the like;&#8221; <i>ocean current</i>, <i>city life</i>.</p>

<p>6. &#8220;Supporting or advocating;&#8221; <i>union man</i>, <i>Bryan voter</i>.</p>

<p>7. &#8220;Existing in or coming from;&#8221; <i>Yellowstone geyser</i>, <i>California lemon</i>.</p>

<p>8. &#8220;Originated or made by, named for;&#8221; <i>Gordon Press</i>, <i>Harvard College</i>.</p>

<p>Placing the two nouns in apposition is much the same as using the first as an adjective.</p>

<p>Such compounds are generally written as two words without the
hyphen, but see specific rules for use of hyphens.</p></div>

<p>II<span class="spacer2">&nbsp;</span>Every name apparently composed of a plain noun and a noun of agent or
verbal noun, but really conveying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span> the sense of a phrase with suffix
<i>er</i>, <i>or</i>, or <i>ing</i>, should be treated as a compound; <i>roller distribution</i>.</p>

<p>III<span class="spacer2">&nbsp;</span>Possessive phrases used as specific names (generally plants) are treated as compounds.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>They are hyphenated unless very common, in which case they are
closed up; <i>crane&#8217;s-bill</i>, <i>ratsbane</i>.</p></div>

<p>IV<span class="spacer2">&nbsp;</span>Any phrase used as a specific name in an arbitrary application not
strictly figurative is written as a compound; <i>blueberry</i>, <i>red-coat</i>, <i>forget-me-not</i>.</p>

<p>V<span class="spacer2">&nbsp;</span>Any pair of words used as one name of which the second is a noun but
the first not really an adjective should be written as a compound;
<i>foster-brother</i>, <i>down-town</i>, <i>after-consideration</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>As elsewhere the use of the hyphen depends largely in the
familiarity of the phrase; <i>spoilsport</i>, <i>pickpocket</i>.</p></div>

<p>VI<span class="spacer2">&nbsp;</span>Any two words other than nouns should be treated as a compound,
generally solid, when arbitrarily associated as a name; <i>standpoint</i>, <i>outlook</i>.</p>

<p>VII<span class="spacer2">&nbsp;</span>A name or an adjective made by adding a suffix to a proper name
compounded of two words should be treated as a compound with a hyphen;
<i>East-Indian</i>, <i>New-Yorker</i>. If the name is not inflected this rule does
not apply; <i>East India Company</i>, <i>New York man</i>.</p>

<p>VIII<span class="spacer2">&nbsp;</span>Any pair or series of words arbitrarily associated in a joint sense
different from their sense when used separately, should be compounded; <i>workman-like</i>, <i>warlike</i>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>COMPONENTS OF COMPOUNDS</h3>

<p>Compounds having the force of nouns may be made up in several ways.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. Two nouns used in other than their natural signification; <i>claw-hammer</i>.</p>

<p>2. A noun and an adjective used in other than their natural signification; <i>great-uncle</i>, <i>dry-goods</i>.</p>

<p>3. A noun and an adverb; <i>touch-down</i>, <i>holder-forth</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>4. A noun and an adverb; <i>down-draft</i>, <i>flare-back</i>.</p>

<p>5. A noun and a verb; <i>know-nothing</i>, <i>draw-bar</i>.</p>

<p>9. A verb and an adverb; <i>cut-off</i>, <i>break-up</i>.</p>

<p>10. A verb and a preposition; <i>to-do</i>, <i>go-between</i>.</p></div>

<p>Compounds having the force of adjectives may be made up in several ways.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. A group of words compacted into one idea; <i>never-to-be-forgotten</i>.</p>

<p>2. Two adjectives; <i>white-hot</i>, <i>ashy-blue</i>.</p>

<p>3. An adjective and a participle or noun and suffix simulating a
participle; <i>odd-looking</i>, <i>foreign-born</i>, <i>bow-legged</i>.</p>

<p>4. An adjective and a noun; <i>fire-new</i>, <i>type-high</i>.</p>

<p>5. A noun and a participle (or noun and suffix simulating a
participle); <i>hand-printed</i>, <i>peace-making</i>.</p>

<p>6. An adverb and an adjective used together before a noun; <i>well-bred</i>, <i>long-extended</i>.</p>

<p>7. Two nouns used adjectively before another noun; <i>cotton-seed
oil</i>, <i>shoe-sewing machine</i>, <i>Sunday-school teacher</i>.</p>

<p>8. An adjective and a noun used together before a noun;
<i>civil-service examination</i>, <i>free-trade literature</i>, <i>fresh-water sailor</i>.</p>

<p>9. A verb and a noun; <i>John Lack-land</i>.</p></div>

<p>Four compounds occur with the force of verbs.</p>

<p>2. A verb and a noun; <i>silver-plate</i>, <i>house-break</i>.</p>

<p>3. A verb and an adjective; <i>cold-press</i>, <i>fine-still</i>.</p>

<p>4. A verb and an adverb; <i>cross-examine</i>.</p></div>

<p>Several combinations are used with the force of adverbs.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. Two adverbs; <i>upright</i>, <i>henceforth</i>.</p>

<p>2. A noun and an adverb; <i>brain-sickly</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>3. An adjective and an adverb (or compound adjective with suffix,
simulating an adverb); <i>stout-heartedly</i>, <i>ill-naturedly</i>.</p>

<p>4. An adjective and a verb; <i>broadcast</i>.</p>

<p>5. Two nouns; <i>piecemeal</i>, <i>half-mast</i>.</p>

<p>6. A noun and an adjective; <i>cost-free</i>, <i>pointblank</i>.</p>

<p>7. A noun and a preposition; <i>down-stairs</i>, <i>above-board</i>, <i>offhand</i>.</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>RULES FOR THE USE OF THE HYPHEN</h3>

<p>1. Hyphenate nouns formed by the combination of two nouns standing in
objective relation to each other, that is, one of whose components is
derived from a transitive verb:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="5" summary="words">
<tr><td><i>well-wisher</i></td><td><span class="spacer">&nbsp;</span></td><td><i>wood-turning</i></td></tr>
<tr><td><i>mind-reader</i></td><td>&nbsp;</td><td><i>child-study</i></td></tr>
<tr><td><i>office-holder</i></td><td>&nbsp;</td><td><i>clay-modeling</i></td></tr></table>

<p>When such compounds are in very common use, and especially when they
have a specific or technical meaning, they are printed solid;</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="5" summary="words">
<tr><td><i>typewriter</i></td><td><span class="spacer">&nbsp;</span></td><td><i>stockholder</i></td></tr>
<tr><td><i>proofreader</i></td><td>&nbsp;</td><td><i>copyholder</i></td></tr>
<tr><td><i>lawgiver</i></td><td>&nbsp;</td><td><i>dressmaker</i></td></tr></table>

<p>2. Hyphenate a combination of a present participle with a noun when the
meaning of the combination is different from that of the two words taken
separately; <i>boarding-house</i>, <i>sleeping-car</i>, <i>walking-stick</i>.</p>

<p>3. Hyphenate a combination of a present participle with a preposition
used absolutely (not governing the following noun); <i>the putting-in or
taking-out of a hyphen</i>.</p>

<p>4. As a rule compounds of <i>book</i>, <i>house</i>, <i>will</i>, <i>room</i>, <i>shop</i>, and
<i>work</i> should be printed solid when the prefixed noun has one syllable;
should be hyphenated when it contains two; should be printed in two
separate words when it contains three or more;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>handbook</i>, <i>notebook</i>, <i>story-book</i>, <i>pocket-book</i>, <i>reference book</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span><i>clubhouse</i>, <i>storehouse</i>, <i>engine-house</i>, <i>power-house</i>,
<i>business-house</i>.</p>

<p><i>handmill</i>, <i>sawmill</i>, <i>water-mill</i>, <i>paper-mill</i>, <i>chocolate mill</i>.</p>

<p><i>classroom</i>, <i>lecture-room</i>, <i>recitation room</i>.</p>

<p><i>tinshop</i>, <i>tailor-shop</i>, <i>carpenter shop</i>.</p>

<p><i>woodwork</i>, <i>metal-work</i>, <i>filigree work</i>.</p></div>

<p>Unusual combinations such as <i>source-book</i> and <i>wheat-mill</i> are
sometimes hyphenated, and the hyphen is sometimes omitted for the sake
of the appearance as in <i>school work</i>.</p>

<p>5. Compounds of <i>maker</i>, <i>dealer</i>, and other words denoting occupation
are generally hyphenated; <i>harness-maker</i>, <i>job-printer</i>.</p>

<p>The tendency is to print these words solid when they come into very common use; <i>dressmaker</i>.</p>

<p>6. Hyphenate nouns when combined in an adjectival sense before the name
of the same person; <i>the martyr-president Lincoln</i>, <i>the poet-artist Rosetti.</i></p>

<p>7. Compounds of <i>store</i> are generally hyphenated when the prefix
contains one syllable, otherwise not; <i>drug-store</i>, <i>fruit-store</i> (but
<i>bookstore</i>), <i>provision store</i>.</p>

<p>8. Compounds of <i>fellow</i> are hyphenated; <i>fellow-being</i>, <i>play-fellow</i>, but <i>bedfellow</i>.</p>

<p>9. Compounds of <i>father</i>, <i>mother</i>, <i>brother</i>, <i>sister</i>, <i>daughter</i>,
<i>parent</i>, and <i>foster</i> should be hyphenated when the word in question
forms the first part of the compound; <i>father-love</i>, <i>mother-country</i>,
<i>brother-officer</i>, <i>sister-state</i>, <i>daughter-cell</i>, <i>parent-word</i>,
<i>foster-brother</i>, but (by exception) <i>fatherland</i>.</p>

<p>10. Hyphenate compounds of <i>great</i> in phrases indicating degrees of
descent; <i>great-grandmother</i>, <i>great-great-grandfather</i>.</p>

<p>11. Hyphenate compounds of <i>life</i> and <i>world</i>; <i>life-history</i>,
<i>world-influence</i>, but (by exception) <i>lifetime</i>.</p>

<p>12. Compounds of <i>skin</i> with words of one syllable are printed solid,
otherwise as two separate words; <i>calfskin</i>, <i>sheepskin</i>, <i>alligator skin</i>.</p>

<p>13. Hyphenate compounds of <i>master</i>; <i>master-builder</i>, <i>master-stroke</i>, but (by exception) <i>masterpiece</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>14. Hyphenate compounds of <i>god</i> when this word forms the second
element; <i>sun-god</i>, <i>war-god</i>, <i>godsend</i>, <i>godson</i>.</p>

<p>15. Hyphenate compounds of <i>half</i> and <i>quarter</i>; <i>half-truth</i>,
<i>quarter-circle</i>, <i>half-title</i>, but on account of difference in meaning
of <i>quarter</i>, <i>quartermaster</i>, <i>headquarters</i>.</p>

<p>16. These prefixes</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="5" summary="words">
<tr><td><i>ante</i>-</td><td><span class="spacer">&nbsp;</span></td><td><i>infra</i>-</td><td><span class="spacer">&nbsp;</span></td><td><i>re</i>-</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>anti</i>-</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td><i>inter</i>-</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td><i>semi</i>-</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>bi</i>-</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td><i>intra</i>-</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td><i>sub</i>-</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>co</i>-</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td><i>pre</i>-</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td><i>super</i>-</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>demi</i>-</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td><i>post</i>-</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td><i>tri</i>-</td></tr></table>

<p>are ordinarily joined to the word with which they are used without a
hyphen, except when followed by the same letter as that with which they terminate or by <i>w</i> or <i>y</i>;</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="5" summary="words">

<i>overemphasize</i>, <i>underfed</i>, but <i>over-careful</i>, <i>over-spiritualistic</i>.</p>

<p>20. Combinations having <i>self</i> and <i>by</i> as the first element of the
compound call for a hyphen; <i>self-evident</i>, <i>self-respecting</i>, <i>by-law</i>,
<i>by-product</i>, but <i>selfhood</i>, <i>selfish</i>, and <i>selfsame</i>.</p>

<p>21. Combinations of <i>fold</i> are printed as one word if the number
contains only one syllable but as two if it contains more than one;</p>

<tr><td><i>tenfold</i></td><td>&nbsp;</td><td><i>a hundred fold</i></td></tr></table>

<p>22. Adjectives formed by a noun preceding <i>like</i> do not take a hyphen if
the noun is a monosyllable, except when ending in <i>l</i> or a proper noun;
if the noun contains more than one syllable a hyphen should be used;
<i>childlike</i>, <i>warlike</i>, <i>catlike</i>, <i>bell-like</i>, <i>Napoleon-like</i>, but (by
exception) <i>Christlike</i>.</p>

five-eighths</i>, <i>thirty-hundredths</i>, <i>ninety-two thousandths</i>.</p>

<p>Do not use the hyphen in an instance as &#8220;<i>One half the business is owned
by Mr. Jones, one quarter by Mr. Smith, and one eighth each by Mr.
Browne and Mr. Robinson.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>26. Where two or more compound words occur together having one of their
components in common, this component is often omitted from all but the
last word and the omission indicated by a hyphen;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>French-and Spanish-speaking countries</i>, <i>wood-iron-and
steel-work</i>, <i>one-two-three-four and five-cent stamps</i>.</p>

<p>This usage is objected to in some offices as being a Germanized
form. It is however, less ambiguous than where the hyphen is
omitted and is therefore preferable.</p></div>

<p>27. Ordinal numbers compounded with nouns take the hyphen in such
expressions as <i>second-hand</i>, <i>first-rate</i>, and the like.</p>

<p>28. Numerals of one syllable take a hyphen in compounds with
self-explanatory words such as <i>four-footed</i>, <i>one-eyed</i>, and the like.</p>

<p>29. Numerals compounded with nouns to form an adjective take the hyphen;
<i>twelve-inch rule</i>, <i>three-horse team</i>, <i>six-point lead</i>.</p>

<p>30. The hyphen is used in compounding a noun in the possessive case with
another noun; <i>jew&#8217;s-harp</i>, <i>crow&#8217;s-nest</i>.</p>

<p>31. The hyphen is used with most compounds of <i>tree</i>; <i>apple-tree</i>,
<i>quince-tree</i>, but not when a particular object, not a tree (vegetable),
is meant; <i>whippletree</i>, <i>crosstree</i>.</p>

<p>32. Use the hyphen in compounding two adjectives generally, especially
personal epithets; <i>asked-for opinion</i>, <i>sea-island cotton</i>, <i>dry-plate
process</i>, <i>hard-headed</i>, <i>strong-armed</i>, <i>broad-shouldered</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>33. The hyphen is not used in points of the compass unless doubly
compounded; <i>northeast</i>, <i>southwest</i>, <i>north-northeast</i>, <i>south-southwest by south</i>.</p>

<p>34. Compounds ending with <i>man</i> or <i>woman</i> are run solid; <i>pressman</i>, <i>forewoman</i>.</p>

<p>35. Omit the hyphen in such phrases as <i>by and by</i>, <i>by the bye</i>, <i>good
morning</i> (except when used adjectively, <i>a good-morning greeting</i>,)
<i>attorney at law</i>, <i>coat of arms</i>.</p>

<p>36. Compounds ending in <i>holder</i> and <i>monger</i> are run solid;

<tr><td><i>everywhere</i></td><td>&nbsp;</td><td><i>anyway</i></td><td>&nbsp;</td><td><i>somewhat</i></td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td><i>somewhere</i></td></tr></table>

<p>In phrases like <i>in the meantime</i> and <i>forever and ever</i> the words are printed separately.</p>

<p><i>Any one</i> and <i>some one</i> are separate words.</p>

<p>40. In compounds of color the hyphen is not used except when a noun is
used with an adjective to specify color; <i>reddish-brown</i>, <i>gray-white</i>,
<i>lemon-yellow</i>, <i>olive-green</i>, <i>silver-gray</i>.</p>

<p>41. Following is a list of words of everyday occurrence which should be
hyphenated, and which do not fall under any of the above classifications.</p>

<tr><td><i>fountain-head</i></td></tr></table>

<p>These rules are the consensus of opinion of a considerable number of
good authorities from DeVinne (1901) to Manly and Powell (1913). The
great practical difficulty is that authorities differ as to their
application. DeVinne uses the dieresis instead of the hyphen in such
cases as <i>co-operate</i> or <i>pre-eminent</i>, writing <i>co&ouml;perate</i>,
<i>pre&euml;minent</i>. Many of the rules have exceptions and authorities differ
as to the extent of the exceptions. There are many differences in the
great number of unclassified compounds. For example, Manly and Powell
write <i>coat-of-arms</i>, while Orcutt writes <i>coat of arms</i>. Common usage
omits the hyphen from post office except when used as an adjective, e. g.,
<i>post-office accounts</i>.</p>

<p>A strict adherence to the rules given would probably result, not in bad
composition, but in a much greater use of hyphens than would be found on
the pages of many recent books from the presses of some of the best
publishers. This is due partly to the fact that usage has never been
strictly uniform and partly to the constant progressive change noted at
the beginning of this study. We are gradually discontinuing the use of
the hyphen just as we are diminishing our use of capital letters,
punctuation marks, and italics.</p>

<p>The compositor should ground himself thoroughly in the principles and
rules. He should learn the best usage with regard to special words and
phrases. He should master the office style. He should follow copy if the
author has distinct and definite ideas which are not absolutely wrong
and would not introduce inconsistencies in magazines and the like by
violating the office style which is followed in other parts of the same
publication. If it is clear that the author knows what he wants, the
compositor should follow copy. Questions of correctness and conformity
to style belong not to him but to the copy editor and proofreader.</p>

<p>62. What is the duty of the compositor in these cases, especially when doubtful?</p>

<p>In this volume, as in so many in this section, much depends upon
practice drills. The memorizing of rules is difficult and is of very
little use unless accompanied by a great deal of practice so that the
apprentice will become so thoroughly familiar with them that he will
apply them at once without conscious thought. He should no more think of
the rule when he writes <i>fellow-man</i>, than he thinks of the
multiplication table when he says seven times eight are fifty-six. This
drill may be given in several ways, by asking the student to explain the
use or omission of hyphens in printed matter, by giving written matter
purposely incorrect in parts and asking him to set it correctly, or by
giving dictations and having the apprentice write out the matter and
then set it up. Later, when it will not be too wasteful of time, the
apprentice can be given the ordinary run of copy as customers send it in
and told to set it in correct form. He will probably find enough errors
in it to test his knowledge of compounding and of many other things.</p>

general make-up, in typography, illustrations, etc., has been, as far as
practicable, kept in harmony throughout. A brief synopsis of the
particular contents and other chief features of each volume will be
found under each title in the following list.</p>

<p>Each topic is treated in a concise manner, the aim being to embody in
each publication as completely as possible all the rudimentary
information and essential facts necessary to an understanding of the
subject. Care has been taken to make all statements accurate and clear,
with the purpose of bringing essential information within the
understanding of beginners in the different fields of study. Wherever
practicable, simple and well-defined drawings and illustrations have
been used to assist in giving additional clearness to the text.</p>

<p>In order that the pamphlets may be of the greatest possible help for use
in trade-school classes and for self-instruction, each title is
accompanied by a list of Review Questions covering essential items of
the subject matter. A short Glossary of technical terms belonging to the
subject or department treated is also added to many of the books.</p>

<h2>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</h2>

<p class='dropcap'><span class="caps">This</span> series of Typographic Text-books is the result of the splendid
co-operation of a large number of firms and individuals engaged in the
printing business and its allied industries in the United States of America.</p>

<p>The Committee on Education of the United Typothetae of America, under
whose auspices the books have been prepared and published, acknowledges
its indebtedness for the generous assistance rendered by the many
authors, printers, and others identified with this work.</p>

<p>While due acknowledgment is made on the title and copyright pages of
those contributing to each book, the Committee nevertheless felt that a
group list of co-operating firms would be of interest.</p>

<p>The following list is not complete, as it includes only those who have
co-operated in the production of a portion of the volumes, constituting
the first printing. As soon as the entire list of books comprising the
Typographic Technical Series has been completed (which the Committee
hopes will be at an early date), the full list will be printed in each
volume.</p>

<p>The Committee also desires to acknowledge its indebtedness to the many
subscribers to this Series who have patiently awaited its publication.</p>
